How to Run the Script

1) Install exiftool: Download and install exiftool. Already in file.

2) Update the path to exiftool.exe in the get_camera_orientation_pitch function:
    command = [
        'exiftool.exe',
        '-json',
        '-CameraOrientationNEDPitch',
        filepath
    ]
3) Set Up Directory Paths: Make sure your directory structure is set up correctly.
    Update the source and destination directories in the if __name__ == "__main__": section:

        source_dir = r'C:\path\to\directory\geospatial-flask-app\app\static\images'
        range_40_50_dir = r'C:\path\to\directory\geospatial-flask-app\app\static\images\range_40_50'
        range_55_65_dir = r'C:\path\to\directory\geospatial-flask-app\app\static\images\range_55_65'
4) Activate Virtual Environment in command prompt or terminal:

        .\venv\Scripts\activate

5) Run the Script:

        python process_images.py

6) Check Output:

        The script will print the image filenames and their pitch values.
        Images will be moved to the respective directories based on their pitch values.
        If no pitch data is available, it will print a message indicating so.
